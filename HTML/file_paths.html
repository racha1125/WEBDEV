    <h2>Absolute File Path</h2>
    <h3>Relative to the root directory</h3>
    <p>Example: C:/Users/Ras/Desktop/Project/Images/cat.png</p>
    <h2>Relative File Path</h2>
    <h3>Relative to the current directory.</h3>
    <p>If you are working on index.html file in Project Directory.<br>The Project Directory is the current directory.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example-1: Images/cat.png</li>
        <li>Example-2: ./Images/cat.png <br> "./" tells the system to stay in the current directory and search for file "cat.png"</li>
    </ul>    
    <h3>If we want to go to Desktop Folder which contains our Project Folder<br>and get some image named "dog.png" from their using relative file path,<br> the path is as follows: <br><br><i>File Path: ../dog.png</i></h3>
    <p>the ""../"" takes us a level up in the file hierarchy.(i.e.,desktop folder which the contains the project folder)</p>
